# Introduction

This repository contains the code used to perform the analyses in the paper "Mind the gap: characterizing bias due to population mismatch in two-sample Mendelian randomization". It can be divided into three sections: 

1. Performing two-sample MR (2SMR) across 128 exposures and 88 outcomes.

2. Downstream processing of 2SMR results, such as Steiger filtering and estimate rescaling

3. Downstream analyses on 2SMR results such as calculating concordance z-scores, calculating shrinkage coefficients using simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), and the replication analysis assessing the tradeoff between bias and power in Biobank Japan.
